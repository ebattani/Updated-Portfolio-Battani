         <h2>About Me</h2>

         <p>Hi, I'm Ethan. A full stack developer living in Denver, Colorado. I recently moved here with the intention of creating a new life and new career path for myself. Feel free to browse and check out some of my recent projects below!</p>

        <!-- <h2>More About Me</h2> -->

        <p>
          I graduated from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor's in Public and Non-Profit Administration and a Business minor. My intention was to work for a non profit organization with the intention of creating and running my own. While running an organization is still a goal of mine. The tech industry provides more opportunity and work-life balance. 
        </p>

        <p>
          As I navigate through life, I have realized the importance of enjoying what you do for work. Coding is a passion and a life long love for me. I was first introduced to coding around 2014 in my engineering classes at GVSU. While I did not enjoy the other facets of the degree, coding was the one portion that I truly fell in love with. That brings us to present day. I have decided to move away from my Project Manager career in Hospitality. While I love the people I work with, I do not have a profound love for the act, like I do with coding. I have learned an immense amount from being a Project Manager and I know that I can bring what I've learned to the tech industry.
